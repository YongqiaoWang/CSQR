# CSQR: convex superquantile regression
This package is used to estimate superquantile frontier for efficiency analysis.
The frontier is assume to be increasing and concave.
It is in same framework of convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS), convex quantile regression (CQR), convex expectile regression (CER).
